# Dilemma-of-Chick
This game is made by applying the prisoner's dilemma. The two chicks risk each other's eggs and choose whether to betray or cooperate. When both cooperate, they receive a predetermined egg. If you betray both, you lose a lot of eggs. If only one of them betrays, the betrayer gets a lot of eggs.
